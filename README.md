# Power Notifier
 
    Power Notifier notifies you about when your PC battery has reached below certain percentage or have been fully charged or about to be discharged.
    
## How to use this on your PC

    Since this project is still in development but I have released some basis codes of power notifier. You can use power notifier by just putting `powerNotifier.py` file in your PCs startup folder. This has been tested only for windows. But if you know what you are doing you can use it however you want. This is no current license for this basic code version.
    
### Startup folder directory for windows

dir = `C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup'
