# Power Notifier
 
Power Notifier notifies you about when your PC battery has reached below certain percentage or have been fully charged or about to be discharged.
    
## How to use this on your PC

Since this project is still in development, I have released some basic codes of powerNotifier. You can use powerNotifier by just putting `powerNotifier.pyw` file in your PCs startup folder. This has been tested only for windows. But if you know what you are doing you can use it however you want.
    
### Startup folder directory for windows

dir = `C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
